How to edit code through Github:
Step 0: Everytime you open Github press sync to get any changes other people made.
1. Make any changes to code through Github folder
2. Edit the Summary and Description through Github app
3. Press commit to master
4. Press publish/sync

The master branch is the main branch and any other branches created will be based off of it.

Committing is the same thing as saving except with more commitment.

Other cool stuff Github can do:
If your code somehow just doesn't work anymore and you have no clue how to fix, you can rollback to a prior commit that actually works.
You can create different "branches" of the same code. for example:
1. A branch focused on what the robot does for the first half of the course (white floor) and a branch for the second half (black floor). Then combine the branches.
2. An "experimental" branch for any coding you want to try but you don't want to risk messing up the master branch.
